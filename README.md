# TradingDataAnalysis
This is a repo of a personal project of mine where I wanted to simulate, analyze and visualize a trading firms data.

First I needed to simulate trading data, to get an idea of what the data would look like I reached out to a business connection who is a head at a top cryptocurrency trading firm.

He told me that for this project it would make sense for me to format the data into a .csv with 3 collumns, 'userid', 'tradevalue' and 'tradedate'. Obviously there is more data that could be used, but
for this project sake I worked with this becuase it would form a solid base to continue from.

From there then I went to python to write a script that would generate the data. A similar script I used can be found in the 'Generate_Data.py' python file. 

Then to simulate the environment of a trading firm I converted the csv into a database and uploaded it to MySQL Workbench 8.0.

From there, the data was analyzed in SQL.
